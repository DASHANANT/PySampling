Sampling
------------
The use of sampling is to a make inferences about a population
It is not practicable to examine each individual unit of a large dataset, therefore few units of the lot are examined and on the basis of the information of those units, which is used to make decisions about whole data.

Types Of Sampling
-------------
Sampling schemes can be categorised as follows:
- 1. Non-probability sampling;
- 2. Probability or random sampling; and
- 3. Mixed sampling.

Some problems arise regarding the sampling :

- 1. Determination of Base of Sampling
    Sample size should neither be too small nor too big. 
    
    Sample size depends on the following points:
          1. Homogeneity or heterogeneity of population;
          2. Nature of investigation; 
          4. Level of purity; and
          5. Sampling method.

- 2. Discussion on Effect of Biasedness in Sampling
    Partiality, predecided and unknowingly happenings make impure the
    sample. So it is necessary to beware of that.

- 3. Reliability in Sampling
    This can be done in following ways:
        1. Comparison of sample after dividing in two equal parts;
        2. Selection of another sample of same size from the same population and
          comparison; and
        3. Comparison of the result of a sub-sample to the result of the sample
          itself.
